        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk or water (makes them fluffier)</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon butter or oil</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>


        <ol>
            <li>Whisk it Up: In a small bowl, crack the eggs. Add the milk or water, salt, and pepper. Whisk everything together with a fork until the yolks and whites are fully combined and slightly frothy. If using turmeric, whisk it in now.</li>

            <li>Melt the "Sunshine": Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the butter or oil and let it melt and coat the bottom of the pan evenly.
            </li>

            <li>
            Pour and Wait: Pour the egg mixture into the hot pan. Let it cook undisturbed for about 30 seconds to a minute, until the edges start to set.</li>

            <li>Gentle Scramble: Using a spatula, gently push the cooked egg from the edges towards the center, tilting the pan so the uncooked egg flows underneath. Continue this process until most of the egg is cooked but still slightly moist.
            </li>

            <li>Add Boosters (Optional): If you're using cheese or chopped bell pepper, sprinkle them over the eggs during the last minute of cooking. Cook until the cheese is melted or the pepper is slightly softened.
            </li>

            <li>Serve and Enjoy: Slide the "Sunshine Scramble" onto a plate and enjoy immediately!
            </li>
        </ol>
